### How to file a pull request

That will change on what your contribution is trying to achieve. Are you fixing a bug? Proposing an enhancement? Adding a new functionality?

The nice to have structure for those pull requests is:

1. Add an objective title to it, demonstrating what you want to achieve with it, e.g.: "adding support to effect X on library Z" or "fixing an issue with the packet database"
2. Depending on what you're targeting, attach screenshots with the before and after your changes on the client.

We will have an automated mechanism that will do a basic evaluation on the code being offered via the PR, the bare minimum expected is that the project build is passing.

### How to file a bug report

You can open a bug report on the [issues](https://github.com/MrAntares/roBrowserLegacy/issues) page, giving at the bare minimum
the following information:

> 1. What is the roBrowserLegay git commit you're using?
> 2. What NodeJS, browser and operating system you're using?
> 3. What did you do when found this bug?
> 4. What did you expected to happen instead of the error?

You can attach videos and images to help even more, you can upload the videos on platforms like streamable.com or youtube.com. Just
make sure they are public accessible, focus on showing pertinent information about the bug you're reporting.

### Release process

Maintainers of the project can generate new [releases](https://github.com/MrAntares/roBrowserLegacy/releases) for the project by creating tags on specific master branch commit.
After the tag is created and pushed to the GitHub repo, a workflow will be triggered to generate the release package.

They will decide when and how those tags will be applied and which releases they need to generate.
