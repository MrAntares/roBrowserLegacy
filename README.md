## ROBrowser Legacy
This is a continuation of [roBrowser](https://www.robrowser.com/) expanded with some features. This repo is not directly forked from the original repository due to safety concerns, but it is roBrowser.

## Remote Client
Remote Client serves game assets to roBrowser via http by extracting them from their GRFs. You will need to setup a remote client if you want to serve the game assets centrally from your server. roBrowser can use local game assets via the Intro screen by dragging them into the file box. The original implementation of the Remote Client is written in PHP and can be found in the [roBrowserLegacy-RemoteClient-PHP](https://github.com/MrAntares/roBrowserLegacy-RemoteClient-PHP) repository. Other implementations may arise and when they do we will list them here.

## Plugins
For available plugins and information on how to install them please visit the [roBrowserLegacy-plugins](https://github.com/MrAntares/roBrowserLegacy-plugins) repository.
